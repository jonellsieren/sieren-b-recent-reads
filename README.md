# Recent Reads
2020 | Jo-Nell Sieren

## About
The web app will show a list of recently read books of various genres.  The data will provide the title, author, year published, genre, rating, purchase link, user review, and book cover image.  The user will be able to sort 5-star rated books to identify their favorites quickly. The user will be able to edit fields to update information. For a more complex (for me) option, I would like to have icons for selecting a genre, and then the user could sort by those graphics.

## Status
The app allows users to log data for a recent book they read. The can edit, delete, and review all of the data. In the future there will be a an image pulled from a database.
